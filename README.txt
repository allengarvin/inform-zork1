I wrote this in the early 2000s after using my early zmachine decompiler. No one has ever seen this apart from me, I think. There are probably lots of bugs--it's a mix of Inform's libraries and things recoded to look like the original Zork. Now that the ZIL code has been released a couple years, I feel like I can put this out. 

Note the ugly hack to create the arrays for combat--Inform has no easy way to handle multiple-dimension arrays, so I had to get creative, to avoid recoding the combat.

The file modification times are all from 2007, but that was probably when I copied over the files from a previous computer. I don't think this has been touched since at least 2004 or so.
